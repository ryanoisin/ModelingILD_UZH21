# Modeling Intensive Longitudinal Data in Discrete and Continuous Time: The basics
A repository containing materials for the workshop "Modeling Intensive Longitudinal Data in Discrete and Continuous Time: The basics". 

The workshop consists of two parts, of which each consists of a `lecture` and `lab` component. Part 1 covers Discrete-Time modeling, with the practical part focusing on the estimation of time series models in `R` and `jags`. 
Part 2 covers Continuous-Time modeling, with practical focusing on estimation of models using `ctsem` in `R`.

## Preperation
The workshop will primarily use the `R` programming language, for which we recommend `version 4.0.4` or `4.0.5`. This can be downloaded from [cran](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/). We also require participants to download the `jags` programme to allow fitting of Bayesian time series models. This can be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/). We also require users to make use of a variety of `R` packages. To install and check that these packages function correctly, we have supplied a script and minimal working example in the `setup` folder. Please install all software and packages before the start of the workshop.


## Workshop Files

There are three main folders in the repository
- `setup` contains materials which participants should engage with **before** the start of the lab, relating to installing and checking relevant software packages
- `Day 1 (Discrete-Time Modeling)` 
- `Day 2 (Continuous-Time Modeling)`

You can follow the lab parts of the sessions by opening the `.html` file in each subfolder
